            <p class="test"> " I'm 30 years old and only 2 weeks off antidepressants for the first time in years thanks to tranquil minds. I was on antidepressants due to getting beaten up daily, verbally abused, falsely accused of crimes, and more stuff due to being transgender. Therapy helped a lot, but it takes a while. I was impatient and thought a few sessions would be all I needed, however I needed multiple tranquil minds resources to start living a better life. 
                Getting there now though you can do it. I recommend anyone who wants to go to therapy go! Its Well
                worth it and you can’t put a price on mental health!"

            <p class="test">"I was hesitant to try therapy at first, because as a victim of domestic violence from my ex-wife, I thought no one would believe me, however when I found Tranquil minds, they provided a safe space for me to finally seek help. The therapist they paired me with was very patient and supportive. I never felt judged while going through tranquil minds. I am on a better path now thanks to tranquil minds. I don’t know where I would be without them."</p>
