            <p class="test"> "Yeah, I had to go therapy for years. I'm now 30 and only 2 weeks off antidepressants for
                the first time in years due to getting beaten up daily, verbally abused, false accused of crimes, my
                mom’s car smashed up and a load more stuff due to being a 4chan mod. Therapy helped a lot, but it takes
                a while. I was impatient and thought a few sessions would do me good, but it took years.
                Getting there now though :) you can do it. I recommend anyone who wants to go to therapy go! Its Well
                worth it and you can’t put a price on mental health!"
